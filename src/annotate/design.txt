## Objective
Classify the described video using the provided physical dynamics ontology. Output applicable categories with reasoning based on the description. If no category fits, output "Null".

## Ontology Structure
{ontology}

## Dense video description
{description}

## Output Format Guidelines

### Classification
List ALL applicable ontology categories as comma-separated values

If multiple independent categories apply, list them separately

### Reasoning
Explicitly connect description elements to chosen categories

Use concise, evidence-based explanations

Class:  
Solid, Solid Motion, Solid, External Forces  

Reason:  
The rotating ball indicates solid motion (rotation). Collision demonstrates external forces (impact). 

### Example 2
Class:  
Human, Other Animals, Biological and Biomechanical Motion, Biological Activity

Reason:
this video is about a person playing with his pet dog.
